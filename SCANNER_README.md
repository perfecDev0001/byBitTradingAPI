## Notes

- The scanner is configured to use Bybit's testnet by default. For production use, change `testnet: true` to `testnet: false` in the client initialization.
- To avoid rate limits, the scanner monitors only the first 10 symbols by default. You can modify this in the `initializeWebSockets` function.
- Alerts for each symbol are rate-limited to once per minute to avoid spam.
